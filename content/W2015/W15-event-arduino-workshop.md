Summary: Come learn about digital hardware and Arduino programming in this women-only workshop for beginners!

We're pleased to announce Luxsumi Jeevananthan's hardware workshop this
upcoming [Arduino Day](https://day.arduino.cc/)! Lux and a team of mentors will
introduce you to building prototypes with digital hardware and the software
needed to interact with it.  She writes,

"So you want to be a kickstarter rockstar? Everyone has to start somewhere; for
hardware, that means starting off with an Arduino version of their project.

Do you know how to program, but don't even know where to start with the
hardware? Well, never fear, because WiCS is here! On March 28th, we will be
running a workshop on how to put together hardware components and program them
with an Arduino!  The cost of the workshop is just $25, the price of an
Arduino, and you'll get to take whatever you've built home with you. We'll be
teaching you how to program LEDs and other sensors with the board using an IDE
so that you can get started on your very own project!"

Registration is very limited and first-come first-served, so sign up as soon as
possible! You can register for the workshop and pay the $25 fee in the MathSoc
Office, MC 3038. We'll be accepting registrations until Mon. March 23rd or
until we sell out.
