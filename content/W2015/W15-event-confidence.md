Summary: Big CSters convenes for a discussion circle around the topics of imposter syndrome and self-confidence.

This week's discussion circle theme is self-confidence. We've all faced
imposter syndrome&mdash;feeling like we don't deserve the success we've
achieved.  Inspired by the Write/Speak/Code workshops, we'll be practicing
strategies to own up to our achievements and improve self-confidence. Like the
previous event, we'll also be serving a delicious catered meal&mdash;this week
we'll be featuring Zoup! soup and sandwiches. Come out and meet your fellow
CSters!

**About Big CSters:** Our Big CSters program helps connect cis &amp; trans
